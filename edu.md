# *decoded* – pycobytes

> This is part of my [*decoded*](https://github.com/Sup2point0/Assort/blob/origin/~dev/decoded.md) series, a collection of lessons learnt from each major project I’ve undertaken.

- Front-end development is a little too fun.
- Svelte is awesome.
  - What’s the difference between Svelte and SvelteKit?
- Not everything has to be perfect first try.
  - Flexibility can sometimes be better than perfect planning.
  - So plan *pragmatically* rather than programmatically.
- Sometimes, it pays to have a little faith.
  - That said, leaving stuff until the last minute really isn’t fun.
