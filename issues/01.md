# pycobytes[1] := The Power of List Comprehensions

Sup pips, welcome to the first issue of ***pycobytes***!

We’re gonna dive straight into the deep end and explore one of Python’s most delightful features, what’s known as a ***list comprehension***.

There’s a good chance you’ve faced a situation like this before:

* We have a list of objects.
* We want to do something to each of those objects.
* We store those new objects in another list.

For instance, say we have a list of numbers `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` and want to create a new list with the squares of these numbers.

No problem, we know how to do that!

```py
>>> numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> result = []

>>> for number in numbers:
...     result.append(number ** 2)

>>> result
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
```

Nice. Now this works absolutely fine. But what list comprehensions do is let us condense it, into this:

```py
>>> result = [number ** 2 for number in numbers]
```

Woah, why did everything shift around? Let’s break it down:

![breakdown of how a list comprehension is formed](../assets/issues/01/list-comp-shift-breakdown.png)

So, a list comprehension is a single **expression** with the `for` loop directly embedded in it. If we test this, we’ll get exactly the same result:

```py
>>> numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

>>> result = [number ** 2 for number in numbers]

>>> result
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
```

Now why would you want to do this, you might ask?

Well, for one I think you’d agree there’s an elegance about the list comprehension that is hard to surpass.

Also, turns out performance-wise there *is* a difference. Looking at that first example, it might look pretty harmless, but the call to `.append()` each iteration actually slows it down a lot. As we’re constantly updating the list, Python has to periodically allocate more memory to store the new items – which, like any operation, takes time.

There’s even more exciting stuff you can do with list comprehensions, but we’ll leave here for now. Hope you enjoyed!

Can you write a one-liner to split a number the user inputs into its digits?

```py
>>> Enter a number... 1337
[1, 3, 3, 7]
```

> You can use a `for` loop to iterate through the characters of a string, just like you can with a `list` ;)
