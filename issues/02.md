Hey pips! Manipulating **strings** – that’s the fancy programming term for text values – can often get a fiddly. There’s a good chance you’ve been taught something like this:

```py
>>> name = input()
pypip

>>> message = "Hi there" + name + "!"

>>> print(message)
Hi there,pypip!
```

Here we use the add **operator** `+` to join (**concatenate**) the strings together. But wait, we want a space between `Hi there,` and our name! See, strings are *exact*, so every character matters. If we want whitespace we’ll need to explicitly include it:

```py
>>> print("Hi there, " + name + "!")
Hi there, pypips!
```

We could achieve the same by passing each part straight to the inbuilt `print()` function, which will automatically concatenate the values together, adding a blank space `" "` separator between each.

```py
>>> print("Hi there,", name, "!")
Hi there, pypips !
```

Oh, but now it’s added a space between our name and the exclamation mark too... so we’d have to use a combination instead:

```py
>>> print("Hi there,", name + "!")
Hi there, pypips!
```

Yeah, that’s a bit messy ngl. If only there were a more streamlined and versatile way to incorporate dynamic values into strings.

Enter ***f-strings***. No, they don’t contain rude words, but they start with an `f` before the opening quote mark:

```py
>>> f_string = f"This works just like a regular string!"
>>> print(f_string)
This works just like a regular string!
```

This probably looks a bit weird, but like always, you’ll get used to it. You’ll probably also come to love it, because it makes string manipulation *so* easy. Want to incorporate the `name` variable into your message? Just wrap it in curly braces:

```py
>>> print(f"Hi there, {name}!")
Hi there, pypips!
```

Anything between `{}` in an f-string will be evaluated just like regular Python code, converted to a string `str`, and inserted into the final string value. This is often known among programming languages as **string interpolation**.

Easy, right? And we can do this as much as we want without any increase in complexity:

```py
>>> for i in range(1, 5):
...     print(f"{i} squared is {i ** 2}, {i} cubed is {i ** 3}")
1 squared is 1, 1 cubed is 1
2 squared is 4, 2 cubed is 8
3 squared is 9, 3 cubed is 27
4 squared is 16, 4 cubed is 64
```

Imagine having to build those sentences with `+`s or as multiple arguments to `print()`. Ew.

f-strings make your life so much easier, and mean it’s way easier to quickly see exactly how your text will be formatted.

```py
print(f"Thanks for reading issue#{self.issue_index}, {self.email.recipient.name.capitalize()} :D")
```

There are actually characters other than `f` you can throw before the quote too – [Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals)
